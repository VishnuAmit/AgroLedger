<p align="center">This project aims to solve the problem of lack of transparency in the agro-food supply chain. By using a blockchain-based system and intelligent sensors, consumers can scan a QR code on food packaging to access detailed information about the product they are purchasing, including sustainability scores and toxicity reports. This system reduces waste and fraud and promotes sustainable practices within the industry.
